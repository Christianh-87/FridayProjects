# Friday Project 6 — Advanced Sentiment Analysis of Apple Vision Pro Feedback

## Project Overview
This project analyzes real customer feedback for the Apple Vision Pro headset.  
Using Python, SQLite, and OpenAI’s GPT-5 model, the program performs detailed sentiment analysis and aspect extraction to identify what customers like or dislike about the product.

The analysis supports product development decisions by providing insight into customer perceptions of display quality, comfort, price, and software usability.

## Features
- **Sentiment Categorization:**  
  Each review is classified as Positive, Negative, or Neutral, with reasoning generated by the model.

- **Aspect Extraction:**  
  Key product features such as comfort, display, price, and software are identified and labeled with their associated sentiment.

- **Data Visualization:**  
  The program generates charts showing sentiment distribution and the most frequently mentioned product aspects.

- **Automated Summary Report:**  
  A summary text file (`summary_report.txt`) is automatically generated with key findings and recommendations.
