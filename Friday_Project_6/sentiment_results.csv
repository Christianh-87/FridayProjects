1,"This is not a product, it's an experience. Watching 3D movies is like having an IMAX theater in my living room. I'll never watch a movie on a regular TV again.","Positive
Reason: The review is highly enthusiastic, praising the immersive experience and expressing strong preference over regular TVs.",Positive
2,"The build quality is just... Apple. Premium glass, metal, and fabric. It feels like a $3,500 device. You get what you pay for.","Positive
Reason: The review praises the premium build quality and suggests the high price is justified.",Positive
3,"I'm a huge Apple fan, but I'm underwhelmed. It does a few 'wow' things, but it doesn't do anything *better* than my Mac and iPhone, except for 3D movies. Not worth the price.","Negative
Reason: Despite a few wow moments, the reviewer feels underwhelmed, finds no real advantages over existing devices (aside from 3D movies), and concludes it’s not worth the price.",Negative
4,"Incredible hardware held back by first-gen software. visionOS is beautiful but feels a bit empty. I'm betting on its future potential, but it's not all there yet.","Neutral
Reason: The review praises the hardware and design but criticizes the current software and completeness, expressing mixed feelings and a wait-and-see outlook.",Neutral
5,"It's a lonely, heavy, expensive, and useless device. It does not replace my computer. It does not replace my TV. It just gathers dust. I'm embarrassed I bought it.","Negative
The reviewer expresses strong dissatisfaction, calling the device heavy, expensive, and useless, saying it fails to replace their computer/TV and that they regret buying it.",Negative
6,"It's expensive, yes. But it's the single most impressive piece of technology I've ever owned. It makes me excited about the future.",,
7,"I really wanted to love this, but it's just too isolating. When I'm wearing it, I'm cut off from my family. The EyeSight screen is a gimmick that doesn't work. They just see a blurry image of my eyes.",,
8,"I bought it for work, but the Mac Virtual Display is too limiting with one screen. And any app that isn't native to visionOS is just a floating 2D panel. It's not the revolution I was sold.",,
9,"The M5 is faster, sure, but it's also *heavier* than the M2 according to the specs. The new strap just manages that weight better. It's still a brick on your face.",,
10,"I'm a designer, and being able to see my 3D models in my actual office space is a professional game-changer. This device has already paid for itself in workflow improvements.",,
11,"I was skeptical, but the immersive videos are mind-blowing. The wildlife documentary made me feel like I was actually there. I've never experienced media like this.",,
12,"The passthrough is in a league of its own. I can comfortably walk around my house, grab a drink, and talk to my family without taking it off. It's not perfect, but it's miles ahead of anything else.",,
13,"Typing in the air is slow and awkward. It works for a quick search, but for any real work, you absolutely need a Bluetooth keyboard. Same with the mouse.",,
14,The M5 version is what the original should have been. The new Dual Knit Band is a complete game-changer. I can finally wear this for hours. Absolutely stunning.,,
15,"I felt claustrophobic. The FOV is narrow, and the headset presses on your cheeks and forehead. I couldn't wait to take it off.",,
16,Spatial photos and videos are the killer app no one is talking about. Seeing my kids' birthday party in 3D like I'm standing there again is emotional and priceless. It's a true time machine.,,
17,The Cinema Environment is my favorite feature. But I wish I could invite a friend to watch with me in a spatial call. It's a lonely experience right now.,,
18,"I bought the M5 model for the performance boost. Apps load instantly, and the rendering is noticeably smoother than the M2 I tried. This is the future of computing, and it's finally fast enough to be usable.",,
19,"The M5 model is a fantastic upgrade. The new head strap is much better, but let's be honest—it's still a heavy computer on your face. I can go 2 hours, but not all day.",,
20,"I've never been more disappointed in an Apple product. It's heavy, uncomfortable, and the software is a beta. I felt like an unpaid tester for a product that shouldn't have been released. I got my refund.",,
21,"I keep trying to make it part of my life, but it's a solution in search of a problem. My MacBook and iPad are just faster and easier for 99% of tasks.",,
22,"I'm a gamer, and this is... not a gaming device. Apple Arcade is cute, but it's not a 'killer app.' I'm waiting for real, AAA immersive games.",,
23,"The battery. The cord. What a mess. I'm either stuck to a wall or I have this stupid, heavy battery pack in my pocket with a wire dangling. It's the most 'un-Apple' design ever.",,
24,"I'm sending it back. The eye tracking is 'magic' until you're in a room with complex lighting, and then it just... doesn't work. I found myself pinching at the air like an idiot.",,
25,"My new favorite way to multitask. I can have the basketball game on a giant screen, my email in the corner, and a Safari window open, all while I'm cooking. It's incredible.",,
26,"I'm a VR enthusiast. This has a worse field of view, no tactile controllers, and no games compared to headsets that cost 1/7th the price. The display is nice, but that's it. It's a terrible value.",,
27,"I had the M2 and sold it. It was just too heavy, and I got neck pain. I'm hearing the M5 is better, but I'm not willing to spend another $3,500 to find out.",,
28,"The 'magic' is just marketing. The passthrough is blurry, the Personas are terrifying, and the weight is a serious health hazard for your neck. This is the biggest flop Apple has ever produced.",,
29,"The passthrough is... fine. But it's not 'reality.' It feels like you're watching your life through a high-def camera, which is exactly what it is. It's disorienting.",,
30,"A complete and total rip-off. It's a $500 VR headset with an Apple logo and a $3,000 markup. It does nothing better than its competition and a lot of things worse. Avoid.",,
31,"I love it, but the battery life is a joke. Two hours is just not enough. I'm constantly tethered to the wall with the power adapter, which kind of defeats the 'spatial' freedom.",,
32,"It's a 'Gen 1' product with a 'Gen 3' price. It's heavy, the battery is short, and there's no killer app. I'll be back in a few years when they make 'Apple Vision Air.'",,
33,I'm torn. The technology is 10/10. The practicality is 2/10. It sits on my desk more than it sits on my face. The novelty wore off fast.,,
34,"The spatial audio is magical. It sounds like the audio is coming from the windows in front of me, not from the headset. And when I turn my head, the sound stays put. So immersive.",,
35,"This thing is 90% magic, 10% frustration. The movie-watching experience is 5/5, but the app library is still 3/5. It needs more compelling, native apps.",,
36,"This is not a productivity device. It's a media consumption device. And as a media device, it has no Netflix, no YouTube, and no native Spotify. It's a $3,500 failure.",,
37,"The lens glare is so bad, it's distracting. In any high-contrast scene (like, you know, 90% of movies), there are god rays and reflections all over the place. It completely ruins the immersion.",,
38,"The device is a marvel, but the lack of a native YouTube app is baffling and annoying. Using the web version is a clumsy workaround.",,
39,"I bought the original M2 version used for a great price. For $2,000, it's a 5-star product. For $3,500? I'm not so sure. The value proposition is tough.",,
40,The 'Persona' for FaceTime is still... weird. My colleagues said it's impressive but deep in the 'uncanny valley.' I'd rather just take the headset off.,,
41,"I'm a developer, and I'm disappointed. The tools are limited, and the store isn't driving any real revenue. It feels like Apple has already put this on the back burner. I'm worried about its future.",,
42,"I was blown away by the eye tracking. It literally feels like magic, just looking at something to select it. The interface is the most intuitive thing I've ever used.",,
43,Returned. The eye strain and headaches were immediate. I used it for 30 minutes and had to lie down. This product is not ready for human use. Do not buy.,,
44,"As a developer, the Mac Virtual Display is my entire workflow now. The M5's 120Hz update makes text incredibly sharp. I have a giant, floating 4K monitor wherever I go. Worth every penny for my productivity.",,
45,"The 'infinite canvas' is a lie. You can only use one Mac screen. And the iPad apps are just... iPad apps. They're 2D windows that aren't spatially aware. It's not the future, it's an iPad on my face.",,
46,"The passthrough camera is too low-resolution to read my phone screen or my watch. I have to lift the headset constantly, which defeats the purpose. Very frustrating.",,
47,"I love the 'Environments' feature. When my house is a mess, I just transport myself to Yosemite to focus and get work done. It's an instant zen-like state.",,
48,"Mac Virtual Display is amazing, but why can I only have *one* virtual screen? I'm a developer. I need three! It feels like an arbitrary software limitation. Fix this, Apple!",,
49,"I travel a lot for work. This has completely transformed flying. I just put it on, dial in an Environment, and I'm in my own private theater. Noise-canceling is 10/10. A must-have for frequent flyers.",,
50,"A 4-star product with 5-star potential. It needs more apps, more content, and more social integration. But the foundation is solid.",,
51,"The app selection is a ghost town. It's been over a year (I have the M2), and we still don't have Netflix, Spotify, or a good YouTube app. It's basically a very expensive Safari browser.",,
52,"It's just too heavy. I don't care what head strap you use (I tried three, including the M5's Dual Knit). It's physics. It's a 1.5-pound weight hanging off your face. It's a design flaw.",,
53,"The display is amazing, but the field of view is a bit narrow. It feels like you're looking through a pair of ski goggles. I can't wait for the day this is just a pair of glasses.",,
54,"Spatial videos are the future, but the camera on the Vision Pro itself isn't great. The videos I take with my iPhone 15 Pro look way better. Glad I can view them, but I won't be recording with the headset.",,
55,"The hand and eye tracking is 99% perfect. But that 1% of the time it misses your glance or pinch, it can be really frustrating.",,
56,"I returned it after 10 days. The weight is unbearable. I had a constant headache and neck pain. The M2's Solo Knit band was a terrible design. It's a $3,500 paperweight.",,
57,"I bought the M5, hoping it would fix the M2's flaws. It's faster, and the strap is better. But it's still too heavy, too expensive, and has no apps. It's a marginal improvement on a flawed concept.",,
58,This is the most isolating piece of tech I've ever used. I felt completely cut off from the world and my family. The EyeSight feature is creepy and doesn't help at all. I hated the feeling.,,
59,"Zero 'killer apps' a year and a half after launch. All the hype, all that money, for what? To watch 'Avatar' in 3D? I can do that at the theater. I sold my M2 and didn't look back.",,
60,"visionOS is a marvel of engineering. Moving windows around in 3D space, pinning them to my wall... it just works, flawlessly. The 'wow' factor hasn't worn off.",,
61,"I'm an amazing 4K TV you wear on your face. But it's also uncomfortable, lonely, and has no apps. I'm waiting for Gen 3.",,
62,"It's a $3,500 toy for watching movies. A very, *very* good toy, but a toy nonetheless. The 'Pro' name feels unearned. I'm just not getting any real work done in this.",,
63,"I can't believe how bad the typing is. The 'look and pinch' keyboard is a gimmick that's painfully slow. You are 100% required to buy a separate keyboard, which is ridiculous.",,
64,"The 'Persona' is pure nightmare fuel. I tried a FaceTime call, and my wife told me to take it off immediately. She said I looked like a reanimated corpse. So much for 'connecting' people.",,
65,"The passthrough is the best I've seen, but it still struggles in low light. It gets grainy, and there's some motion blur. It's not 1:1 with human vision, but it's close.",,
66,"I got the M2 version. It's incredible, but it definitely gets warm after about an hour of use. Not uncomfortably hot, but you notice it.",,
67,"The new Dual Knit Band on the M5 is a huge improvement, but why isn't it standard? And $99 for it? Come on, Apple. The comfort should be perfect out of the box at this price.",,
68,"The battery pack is such a clumsy solution. The cable is always in the way, and I'm always worried I'll snag it. Why isn't the battery in the headset? (Oh, right, the weight...)",,
69,"It's cool. But is it $3,500 cool? No. I use it maybe once a week to watch a movie. My Quest 3 is more fun for games and a fraction of the price.",,
70,"The display is amazing, but the field of view is like looking through binoculars. It's not 'immersive' when you can see the black borders all the time.",,
71,"There is nothing—NOTHING—to do on this thing. I watched the two immersive videos, browsed Safari on a big screen, and then... that's it. The app store is a barren wasteland. What a waste of money.",,
72,"The motion blur on the passthrough is nauseating. I tried walking around, and the world warped and smeared. It made me feel sick.",,
73,"I really enjoy using it, but it feels isolating. My family says it's weird to talk to me when I'm wearing it. The EyeSight display doesn't really help.",,
74,"Everything is an expensive add-on. The prescription lenses were $150. The travel case is $200. The M5's new band is $99. The product is $3,500. This is absurd.",,
75,"I held off until the M5 version, and I'm so glad I did. The comfort is there, the power is there. This is the first-gen product that truly feels 'finished.'",,
76,"The Personas are getting so much better. My family said my spatial Persona on FaceTime felt natural and present. It's not perfect, but it's a huge step up.",,
77,"This is the best portable display for my MacBook, period. The M5 version's virtual display is even sharper and smoother. I've sold my external monitor.",,
78,"I love the glare. If you're watching a dark movie with bright text, the lens flare is very noticeable. It's the only mark on an otherwise perfect display.",,
79,"The fit is so finicky. If you don't have it *just right*, it's uncomfortable. I spent the first week just trying to get the Light Seal to feel right. It's a hassle.",,
